Hello world!

A greeting to the void, in case the void is listening.

It's 2020; the world is mostly shutdown due to COVID-19. 
Some are preparing to reboot and shout "Hello world!".
Here, my friends are contemplating for the 5th time this week whether to shave themselves bald.

Being home all the time has given me a lot of time alone with myself.
My past selves - elementary school me, high school me, first year me - pop in and say hello, too.
As they recount their stories to me, I wonder how accurate those memories are.

Were things really as dramatic as I made them out to be? *(Probably not.)*

Or am I gaslighting myself? *(Probably not entirely.)*

Maybe my bias is only letting me remember what I want to remember? *(Definitely.)*

Perhaps I was just overthinking things and I misinterpreted something. *(You couldn't read minds then, and you still can't now.)*

Why did I chase after such a meaningless goal? *(Different time, different priorities.)*

I'll never know to what extent those memories have corrupted. However, I know they keep repeating those stories for a reason - to remind me how much more growing I still have to do.

For me, writing is terrifying, because **it's so easy for your words to take on a life of their own.** 

The last time I really sat down and wrote anything freestyle, it came with unexpected consequences. I won a huge contest and paid off some of my tuition. I made a lot of people upset. I felt guilt, pride, depression, ecstasy, anger - a cocktail of emotions that I didn't know I ordered, but I had to drink anyways. Since then, I've pretty much forgone writing anything unless it was a cover letter or a technical report for an engineering project - nothing raw.

To push myself past my comfort zone and to hone my voice though, means I have to practice writing again.

So begins my cautious steps back into writing, off-script. An experimental reboot of my own.

Here's my

Hello world!
